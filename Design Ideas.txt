Add a “big” laser.  Player gets three of them to start, maybe earns an additional one (up to the max of 3) after each 5 levels they beat.

The big laser clips through barriers, walls, etc.  And it goes up the screen much faster than the normal laser shot.  It doesn’t interrupt firing of the normal laser.  Can only have one big laser on screen at a time.

A shield power up would be nice.  Protects against one hit.  Maybe a random alien can drop it down the screen, like power ups in other vertical shooters.  It activates upon the player touching (colliding) with it and lasts for 5-10 seconds or so.  The player can take one hit when they have the shield without dying, but a hit takes away the shield.

The chance to drop a shield should be pretty low.  Also, if this works well, I could have the player collect big laser shots the same way.

An idea for making the boss harder is to reduce its size by 5% or so each level, while still increasing its speed.  That makes it a significantly harder target to hit.  The boss still eliminates the player if it reaches the bottom of the screen.

Could consider adding more aliens, more pixels to the screen, and different backgrounds as nice-to-haves if I have enough time.  Can also add a bomb, ala the bomb from Star Fox

Take out the .txt file high score thing so that it’s not possible to spoof a high score.

Big Laser shots should use its own function to keep it separate from drawLasers()  updateLasers() checkPlayerLaserHit() etc

This also keeps the original game logic separate and working without introducing problems.

Will also need its own variable to pass and receive from functions.  bigLaser sounds good
drawBigLaser() can be added to show on-screen how many big lasers the player has

player.bigLaserActive
bigLasers[] is the array

Will need a png for both the big laser and the shield power ups, and sfx for both of them too.  Can use the laser sound but add a stereo effect to it with a high and low pitched sound in the L/R speakers

Player gets an extra life after every multiple of a certain score, perhaps 100,000? Can’t go above 3 lives though?

Display a visual cue that the player has scored points by hitting an alien ship.  Can have a score pop up and fade out.  Maybe even add an animation for the alien ship exploding?

Add the level someone game overed in to the high score
